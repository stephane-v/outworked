## How It Works

1. **Hire agents** — Give each one a name, role, personality, model, and pixel sprite
2. **Describe a goal** — Write what you want in plain English; the orchestrator breaks it into subtasks and routes them to the right agents automatically
3. **Watch them work** — Agents walk to their desks, open Claude Code sessions, edit files, run commands, and talk to each other — all visible in the office
4. **Ship code** — Review diffs in the built-in git panel, approve PRs, and merge without ever leaving the app

---

## Why Outworked?

Most AI coding tools give you a chat box. Outworked gives you an **office**.

You don't just prompt one model — you build a team. A frontend agent, a backend agent, a reviewer. They work in parallel, talk to each other, and you can see all of it happening live in a pixel-art world. It's the most fun way to ship code with AI.

## Features

- **Pixel Office** — A Phaser-powered world where your agents walk, sit at desks, and collaborate — in real time
- **Build a Team** — Give each agent a name, role, personality, model, and sprite. Mix Claude Opus for hard problems with Sonnet for fast ones
- **Auto-Orchestration** — Describe a goal; the router breaks it into tasks and assigns them to the right agents
- **Multi-Agent Collaboration** — Agents talk to each other via `[ASK:AgentName]` and a shared message bus
- **Full Claude Code Power** — Every agent gets full tool access (Bash, Edit, Read, etc.) with persistent sessions
- **Live Chat** — Markdown-rendered conversations with syntax-highlighted code blocks and diffs
- **Built-in Git** — View status, staged changes, branches, and create PRs without leaving the app
- **File Browser** — Live-updating workspace tree that syncs as agents edit files
- **Skills System** — Extend agents with plug-in `SKILL.md` files (GitHub, MCP servers, and more)
- **Cost Dashboard** — Track tokens and spend per agent, session, and day
- **Background Mode** — Minimize and let agents keep working. Tray icon keeps you updated
- **Parallel Processing** — Multiple agents tackle subtasks simultaneously
- **Safe by Default** — Approval gates, command allowlists, directory restrictions, timeouts, and full audit logging
- **Desktop Notifications** — Get pinged when tasks finish or agents need approval
- **Original Soundtrack** — Because every office needs a vibe

## Supported Models

| Provider  | Models                             |
| --------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Anthropic | Claude Opus 4.6, Claude Sonnet 4.6 |
| Local     | Any model via Claude Code          |

Each agent can run a different model — pair a fast model for simple tasks with a powerful one for complex work.

## Get Started in 2 Minutes

### 1. Install

**Homebrew (recommended)**

```bash
brew tap outworked/tap
brew install --cask outworked
```

**Manual download**

Grab the latest `.dmg` from the [releases page](https://github.com/outworked/outworked/releases) and drag to Applications.

### 2. Prerequisites

- [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) installed and authenticated (your existing subscription covers usage — no separate API key needed)

### 3. Launch and Hire Your First Agent

On first launch, the onboarding modal walks you through picking a workspace and creating your first agent. You'll be watching pixel employees write code in under two minutes.

### Build from Source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/outworked/outworked.git
cd outworked
npm install
npm run electron:dev
```

## Skills

Outworked uses a `SKILL.md` format — markdown files with YAML frontmatter that define what an agent can do. Bundled skills include:

| Skill        | Description                                           |
| ------------ | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| **github**   | GitHub API access via `gh` CLI (issues, PRs, CI runs) |
| **mcporter** | MCP server support                                    |

Create custom skills by writing a `SKILL.md` file and assigning it to any agent.

## Safety Model

Outworked takes a defense-in-depth approach:

1. **Approval gates** — Explicit approval required before dangerous commands (deletes, installs, network changes)
2. **Command allowlists** — Permit or block specific shell commands per agent
3. **Directory restrictions** — Agents are confined to their workspace
4. **Timeouts** — Configurable limits on long-running tasks
5. **Audit trail** — Full logging of all agent actions
6. **Plan-first execution** — Agents produce a plan before making changes
7. **Permissions dashboard** — Review and manage all access grants in one place

## FAQ

<details>
<summary><strong>Do I need a Claude API key?</strong></summary>

Nope. Outworked runs on Claude Code, so your existing subscription covers everything. No extra keys or billing to set up.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Is my code sent to the cloud?</strong></summary>

Outworked runs locally on your machine. Code is processed through whichever model provider you select for each agent, with the same privacy guarantees as using those APIs directly.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Can agents mess up my codebase?</strong></summary>

Agents require explicit approval for destructive operations, are restricted to their workspace directory, and produce a plan before executing. You can also configure command allowlists and timeouts per agent. See <a href="#safety-model">Safety Model</a>.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>How do I create a custom skill?</strong></summary>

Write a markdown file with YAML frontmatter (name, description, tools) and save it as `SKILL.md`. Then assign it to any agent from the Skills panel. See the bundled skills in `src/basic-skills/` for examples.
